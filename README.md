Project Readme: Overview

Just another Gamer/Developer/Programmer/Artist’s Delusion of Grandeur but maybe something more with time, luck and a lil help. Well make that A LOT of help if I want to finish it in the next 10 years (unless I can grow about 10 more heads and 20 more arms, lol). This is a very ambitious project for one person to even contemplate let alone develop and I'm currently in the early planning stages of design, evaluating existing engines, and prototyping both models and the practical physics that I hope to implement.

To be honest this is a ground up project and I know the odds of completion are not good but determination and commitment are great equalizers.  I hope to find some like minded people who are willing to take on a monster sized project in their free time. Experience is always a plus but not a major requirement. 

Anyone from a Student to a Senior Citizen can contact me about contributing.  I’m looking for intelligent, reliable, creative and artistic people to form the core team for this project.

Here is a very basic overview of the game.

Concept:
-	It will be primarily a Space MMO with Multiplayer Combat at it’s heart
	o	It will be set 800-1000 years in the future
	
	o	The game will run primarily in real-time with few exceptions
	
	o	Real physics will be used everywhere that’s practical
	
	o	It will have Single Player Simulations and Missions
	
	o	Combat may occur in a 1 on 1 situation or with entire fleets commanded by multiple players
	
	o	**Depending on several variables a single player may control up to 12 ships or a ship may have multiple players controlling various stations (I prefer the later choice but it will require a large player base)
	
	o	There will be resource, research, manufacturing and political elements
	
	o	*Non-combat roles will be a choice for players interested in the Political or Artisan areas of the game
	
	o	**All players will advance in rank giving them the ability to perform more simultaneous tasks or command larger ships/fleets
	
	o	*There will be a virtual economy with dire consequences if it becomes unstable!
	
	o	Virtually every aspect of the game will be massively customizable but it will use a very intuitive straightforward interface to lessen the learning curve.
	
	o	Research trees may vary from Faction to Faction and new research options will be heavily influenced by the players.
	
	o	The overall game will be extremely dynamic with technology influencing tactics or tactics influencing research depending on the players.
	
	o	There will be a stabilizing force to balance game play controlled by the Devs (We will be loved and hated but always fair)
	
	o	Plenty of room for future expansions to add different roles. For example, Marines to do boarding actions and combat drops for control of planets would add an FPS aspect to the game.
	
   * These areas are theoretical and the implementations are still under consideration
    ** Details and adjustments to be determined during beta


	
Development:
-	Currently evaluating existing game engines, physics packages, and AI from primarily open-source resources

	o	Primary Development Language: C++

	o	Additional Language – Scripting Possibilities: Java / Lua – Python
		-	Model Prototyping: Maya ECS 2012, 3DSMax, Blender

	o	Other Tools may be considered if a contributor has experience or training with them as long as they can port to a interchange format without loss of detail
	
	o	Planned upgrade to Maya ECS 2013 in the near future

		-	2D Imagining and Textures: Gimp 2.8 / Photoshop CS5 / Misc. Texturing Tools
		
	o	Other Tools may be used, 2d and textures will be either PNG or DDS format

	o	Planned upgrade to Adobe CS6 in the near future	

		-	None of the Languages or Software is committed.


The Future:

-	Assuming I’m the only member of this project:

	o	Phase 1 - Establish a working definition of the mechanics of primary combat and initial weapon systems by 12/15/12.
	
	o	Phase 2 - Basic Models, 2D Prototype GUI Interface and Proof of Concept Tests with several Game Engines and  Physics Models by 3/1/13

	o	Phase 3 - 3D Prototype GUI Interface, Fundamental AI development and testing 4/15/13

	o	Phase 4 - Enhanced Interfaces, Models and Textures for Alpha Deployment of Single Player Core Combat Simulation by 6/1/13

		?	Note although Multiple Platforms are planned only a Windows version will be developed until Beta Testing.

	o	Phase 5 - To be Determined


	

In Conclusion:

  If you took the time to read all this, Thank You! Like I said before I know this is going to be an uphill struggle but I will reach that peak sooner or later. 
  
  This project will remain open source at least through the Alpha Cycle but I can not commit to open source for the entire project life cycle. I believe that to both protect intellectual property rights and proprietary design aspects this project will become commercial at some point in the next 1-2 years. Additionally the project will require funding for Hosting, Hardware, Various Software Packages and hopefully some paychecks so conversion to a commercial basis will be inevitable. With that said I have no intention of forgetting where I got started and I will contribute any modules that don’t infringe on the proprietary design aspects back to the open source community.
  
  I have only touched the surface of what I have planned for this game in this document. This is truly a ground floor opening for individuals that want to join a project that has immense potential, could serve to thicken up your portfolio and possibly be a founding member of a new Development Studio. If you have abilities or experience in any area of game development please contact me and I will give you further details of the game. Please be discreet with any further details and if you join the project be honest and accurate about your abilities.  Even if you don’t have direct experience with a language or software, you can learn it and there are many free learning resources on the internet.  There is room in all areas and I will accept several people of any experience level for each area.  All I ask is you meet any mutually agreed upon deadlines and maintain confidentiality of the details.  

  
  I’m also open to ANY suggestions and the only stupid question is the one that isn’t asked.
